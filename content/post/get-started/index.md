## My Maternity Leave 

In 2023, I took a full year for maternity leave. What initially seemed like stepping away from my professional life turned into a period of growth and skill development that I could not have anticipated.

### Time Management Mastery

When you're caring for a child, time becomes both elastic and precious. I quickly learned that:

1. The traditional schedule becomes obsolete
2. Working in focused 20-30 minute bursts during nap times can be surprisingly productive

These challenges pushed me to develop time management techniques that I never would have discovered otherwise, creating systems that maximized efficiency in ways I hadn't imagined possible before motherhood.

## The Unexpected IDE Adventure

While my baby slept on my chest, I found myself adapting to the strangest "Integrated Development Environments" imaginable:

- Coding one-handed on a tablet
- Voice dictating documentation
- Learning to navigate new development tools that worked better on mobile devices

This constraint-driven innovation not only forced me to adapt to suboptimal hardware options but also inspired me to pursue more user-friendly systems and workflows. 


### Child Learning and Machine Learning

As both a mother and researcher, I've been fascinated by the parallels between my child's language acquisition process and concepts in machine learning:

#### One-Shot Learning Marvels

Witnessing my child learn new words after just a single exposure has given me a profound appreciation for the concept of "one-shot learning" in machine learning. While our sophisticated ML models often require thousands of examples to recognize a pattern, my toddler can:

- Identify a new animal after seeing it once in a picture book
- Correctly apply a new word in multiple contexts after hearing it in just one situation
- Transfer knowledge from one domain to another with minimal guidance

This natural cognitive efficiency has inspired me to explore more efficient training methods in my research, questioning our assumptions about how much data is truly necessary for effective learning.

#### Multi-Feature Entry for Single Labels

The way children process multilingual inputs has fascinating connections to how we handle multi-feature entry for single label classification in ML systems:

- My child seamlessly associates multiple linguistic representations (words from different languages) with a single concept
- They navigate context-switching between languages based on subtle environmental cues
- They develop intuitive feature selection, knowing which language features are relevant in which situations

These observations have influenced my approach to feature engineering and model architecture in my research, particularly in how we handle multi-modal inputs and context-dependent classification tasks.

#### Transfer Learning in Real Time

Perhaps most remarkably, I've witnessed transfer learning happening in real time:

- Grammar patterns learned in one language being tested (sometimes correctly, sometimes humorously) in another
- Conceptual understanding from one domain being applied to solve problems in entirely different contexts
- The natural pruning and reinforcement of neural pathways as certain approaches succeed or fail

These observations have provided valuable intuition for my research on transfer learning mechanisms and adaptive learning systems.


## Looking Forward

This period of maternity leave wasn't just a pause in my career‚Äîit was a profound redirection and enrichment. The skills I've developed, from advanced time management to adaptability in challenging circumstances, have made me more effective in academia and beyond. You cannot just fool around.

As I continue balancing academic life with motherhood, I'm excited to bring these new perspectives into my research and teaching, creating a more integrated approach to both my professional and personal life.
