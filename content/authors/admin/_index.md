      As a contributor to the SAPs4Tissue project. My work focused on investigating the structural dynamics of self-assembling peptides as intrinsically disordered proteins through coarse-grained simulations while characterizing their functional properties. I implemented machine learning algorithms to optimize peptide sequences and developed an internal database that organizes molecular data to facilitate structure-function relationship studies.
